Each day the script will update the CUGS according to
the configuration and information provided by ABN team.

### Verwaltung CUG
Each user with an email address with domain `ag.ch` must receive the CUG `Verwaltung CUG`.
to find users with email address `ag.ch` the script will use the Alma API to search for
users into Analytics.

### Mediotheken CUG
ABN team provides a list of users who must receive the CUG `Mediotheken CUG`. At IZ level,
the system will try to match user accounts according to first name, last name and birth date.

The script will update the users and store a crypted version of the current state of the users
in order to avoid to test again the same users.

The script will also store the logs of the updates in a log file and a report.

All the files will be uploaded into the git repository of ABN.
